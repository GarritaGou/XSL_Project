         <sentence>Hi, everyone.</sentence> 
         
         <sentence>I <font color="red">know</font> you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>I <font color="red">have</font> some important information about a change in the management team.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>As you already <font color="red">know</font>, our head of department, James Watson, <font color="blue">is leaving</font> his position at the end of this week.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>His replacement <font color="blue">is starting</font> at the end of the next month.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as usual.</sentence>
         
         
         <sentence>I <font color="red">have</font> two more quick points.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car park next month for
            a few weeks.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>It will be closed during that time.</sentence>
         
         
         <sentence>
            <font color="red">Do</font>n't <font color="red">worry</font>, we<font color="green">'ve found</font> a solution.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>We <font color="red">can</font> use the local church car park until our own one <font color="red">is</font> ready.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and
            if you <font color="red">arrive</font> after that, you should go directly to the church car park.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>It<font color="red">'s</font> only a five-minute <font color="red">walk</font> away.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>But they <font color="red">need</font> it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>Sorry about that &#x2013; I <font color="red">know</font> how much you all <font color="red">love</font> working late!
         </sentence>
         
         
         <sentence>The other thing I <font color="orange">wanted</font> to <font color="red">tell</font> you about <font color="red">is</font> that the canteen <font color="green">has now introduced</font> a cashless payment system.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>So, you <font color="red">can</font>'t use cash for payments any more.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>You <font color="red">can</font> pay directly with your smartphone or you <font color="red">can</font> pay using your company ID card.
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>The total amount <font color="red">put</font> on your company ID card <font color="red">comes</font> off your salary at the end of each month.
         </sentence>
         
         
         <sentence>OK.</sentence> 
         
         <sentence>That<font color="red">'s</font> it?
         </sentence> 
         
         <sentence>
            <font color="red">Are</font> there any questions?
         </sentence>    
         
      </p>
